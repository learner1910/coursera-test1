			<h2>Move Out,Wolverine!</h2>
			<p>With Avengers: Endgame, Robert Downey Jr.(55 years) has appeared as Tony Stark/Iron Man 10 times on the big screen. This beats Hugh Jackmanâ€™s (51 years) who played wolverine in wolverine trilogy by Marvel Entertainments ,record for the most appearances as a superhero character, but while Hugh Jackman needed 17 years to set his record, Downey Jr. only did it in 11 years.

		<h2>Great Scott!</h2>
		<p>Given that Endgame is all about time travel, there is the inevitable scene where several time travel movies get named by the characters. One of these is Back to the Future, but a subtler reference is also given to that movie in another scene. When Thor leaves New Asgard to join the Avengers again, he is wearing the same kind of sunglasses worn by Marty McFly in Back to the Future Part II.
